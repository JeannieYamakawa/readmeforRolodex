#Digital Rolodex
How many of us have met interesting people and collected their business cards, only to find those cards months later in a random pocket, purse, or garbage can?
The solution to this is the Digital Rolodex app.

Take a photo of a business card while you're on the go, and with the click of a button, Digital Rolodex will create and store an easily-accessible contact list for you.
